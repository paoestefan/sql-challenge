# sql-challenge
Bootcamp challenge

For this challenge I started mapping what I can do with the information provided in the tool called https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/. 
Then I design the tables in the pdAdmin app, & then filled them with the import method learned in class.
I continued by saving this creation file as "Table_schemata.sql" into my local repository.
My next step was to star a new query tool, where I starting making the queries. This file I named it as "Queries.sql"
I solved one by one, having some troubles when I had to make one table with 3. But I solved it re-watching the lessons & making some google-investigation.

I read about the bonus & with a lot of complication I try to solved it at the end. You can find the jupyter notebook attached.
